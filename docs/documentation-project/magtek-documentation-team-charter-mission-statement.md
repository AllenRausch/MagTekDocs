# MagTek Documentation Team Charter/Mission Statement

## Mission Statement

To build and maintain a unified, modern knowledge ecosystem that serves as the single source of truth for all MagTek technical information, empowering internal teams to operate efficiently and enabling our customers to succeed.

## Scope

This charter establishes the framework for the Documentation Modernization Project, transitioning from a reactive, document-centric model to a proactive, knowledge-as-a-platform model.

### In Scope

* **All customer-facing technical documentation:** API references, user guides, SDK documentation, hardware manuals, and troubleshooting.
* **Internal technical knowledge:** System architecture, onboarding guides, and process documentation for Engineering, Support, and QA.
* **Content Lifecycle Management:** Authoring, review, versioning, publishing, and archiving workflows.
* **Unified Information System:** Information architecture and taxonomy of internal documentation. Information architecture and taxonomy of external documentation is a joint project between Documentation and Marketing. &#x20;
* **Platform & Tooling:** The selection, implementation, and governance of the core knowledge base platform and its integrations (e.g., GitHub).

### Out of Scope

* Marketing collateral, marketing elements of the website, sales playbooks, and general HR policies (though integration points may be established).
* Ownership of the look and feel and basic layout of the Marketing and Support site.&#x20;
* Direct ownership of code; ownership is of the _documentation of the code_.

## Guiding Principles

* **Single Source of Truth:** Eliminate duplication and information silos. Every piece of information has one authoritative home.
* **Docs-as-Code:** Treat documentation with the same rigor as software: version-controlled, reviewable, and integrated into the development lifecycle.
* **User-Centric:** Content is structured and written for its target audience, whether an internal engineer or an external integrator.
* **Collaborative by Design:** The system must facilitate seamless contribution and review from all relevant stakeholders, reducing tribal knowledge.
* **Accessible & Secure:** Information is easy to find for authorized users, with clear boundaries between internal and public content.
