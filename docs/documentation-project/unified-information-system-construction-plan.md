# Unified Information System Construction Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan establishes the foundation for transforming MagTek's documentation infrastructure from a fragmented, difficult-to-maintain system into a modern, unified knowledge platform.

* **The Problem:** Critical information is difficult to find, essential documentation is prohibitively hard to update, and a fragmented system hinders both internal productivity and customer support effectiveness.&#x20;
* **The Solution:** A phased approach that prioritizes stakeholder alignment, data-driven tool selection, and careful pilot planning before full-scale implementation.
* **Timeline:**
  * **Phase 1:** Complete discovery, build consensus on problems and strategic direction
  * **Phase 2:** Evaluate solutions, secure stakeholder buy-in and tool approval
  * **Phase 3:** Finalize pilot plans and establish foundation for Q2 launch

**Key Deliverables:**

* Discovery report with strategic recommendations (Phase 1)
* Approved technology stack (Phase 2)
* Complete pilot implementation roadmap (Phase 3)

This plan is designed as a collaborative process with built-in flexibility to accommodate stakeholder schedules while maintaining momentum toward modernization.

## Introduction

The Technical Writer role at MagTek has been strategically re-envisioned from a reactive document creator into a proactive architect of the company's information ecosystem. This transition is a direct response to critical business pain points identified across the organization: Teams are dealing with fragmented documentation across platforms (Agile, Postman, PDFs, emails) which creates confusion and slows down updates. Support relies on 'tribal knowledge' and has no access to internal engineering documentation. Marketing is using an outdated proprietary document management tool that cannot be updated, integrated, or maintained. Finally, the programmer’s manual is consistently cited as difficult to navigate, search, and maintain.

This plan outlines a comprehensive, three-month strategy to dismantle these legacy barriers and lay the foundation for a modern, unified knowledge platform. The goal is to replace outdated, siloed resources (such as the monolithic Word document and scattered Agile entries) with a structured, scalable system built on a docs-as-code foundation. This new ecosystem will serve as a single source of truth, accessible to internal teams (Engineering, Support, Product, and Marketing) and external customers alike, with appropriate security controls.

### Key Goals

This document is structured around three progressive phases: **Discover, Evaluate, and Plan**. Each phase has an overarching theme and a set of concrete, measurable goals. The following sections detail the key projects and deliverables for each phase, designed to build momentum, demonstrate value, and establish a sustainable model for long-term knowledge management.

**Key Goals**

* Create an agreed-upon consensus of current issues.
* Establish stakeholder consensus on documentation strategy.
* Select and validate technology stack with leadership approval
* Deliver migration roadmap and pilot plan ready for execution by end of Phase 3.
* Build cross-functional buy-in through transparency and collaborative decision-making.

### Guiding Principles

This transition will be guided by the following principles:

* **Stakeholder-centered design:** Solutions will be shaped by user needs, not imposed top-down
* **Iterative implementation:** Pilot-test-refine approach to minimize disruption
* **Transparency:** Regular communication and documentation of decision-makes processes
* **Measurable outcomes:** All recommendations backed by data and clear success criteria
* **Sustainability:** Systems designed for long-term maintainability and scalability including AI inclusion, not just quick fixes

_Note: A dedicated Jira project and Kanban board for documentation tasks have been established at_ [_https://magensa.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/DC/list_](https://magensa.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/DC/list)_. Projects in this document are listed by both their functional names and Jira Ticket (DC=Documentation) numbers._

_Note: This plan is designed to be a collaborative and iterative process. Timelines for feedback and decisions are estimates and may be adjusted to accommodate stakeholder availability and ensure full organizational alignment._

## Phase 1: Discover & Align

* Develop training materials and rollout plan for the pilot group of contributors.
* Finalize the setup and configuration of the approved tool in preparation for the pilot launch.

### Support Site Integration Strategy (DC-28)

* In collaboration with Marketing, draft a technical and editorial plan for connecting the new knowledge base to the public-facing support site.
* Define permission models and content reuse strategy to ensure Support has access to internal troubleshooting guides while keeping proprietary information secure.

### Analytics & Success Metrics Framework (DC-29)(DC-30)

* Collaborate with marketing to define and establish baseline measurements for key performance indicators (KPIs) such as page views, search success rates, “time-to-find” reduction, document satisfaction scores, and support ticket deflection.
* Establish secondary set of internal efficiency KPIs to measure progress and success of unified document systems such as production velocity, review cycle time, system uptime, contributor adoption rate, and migration progress.

### Major Deliverable: Programmer’s Manual Taxonomy & Migration Plan (DC-31)

* Break down the monolithic Word document into logical, modular information architecture. Create a phased plan for migrating its content. This plan will prioritize sections based on stakeholder input and include an effort estimate.

### Major Deliverable: Phases 4-6 Roadmap (DC-19)
